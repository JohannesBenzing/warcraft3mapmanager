wc3mapmanager
=============

Tool for the game warcraft 3 frozen throne by Blizzard which allows you to easy find and manage your maps. Currently only for windows. Only tested on windows 7.
To get a quick understanding what this tools is about look at the first screenshot further down.

Features:
  - Load all wacraft 3 maps into a table
  - Filter the table by amount of players, ingamename of the map, filename of the map
  - give your maps tags
  - give your maps ratings
  - move selected map in table into the root map folder of warcraft 3 and all other maps into a backup-folder so you can easily select the selected map in the ingame wacraft3 map chooser


There are 3 versions of this tool:
I recommend using warcraft3mapmangerStyledFullscreen.exe

warcraft3mapmangerStyledWithoutFullscreen.exe does not have a fullscreen mode.

warcraft3mapmanagerUnstyled.exe is a older version and may contain more bugs and looks more like a normal microsoft windows window.

QtLicense at https://qt-project.org/products/licensing

I compiled with MinGW using QtCreator and Qt5.3.0.

todo:
  - automatically detect warcraft 3 maps directory (read from registry)
  - somehow hack warcraft 3 into loading/hosting the selected map. maybe possible with GHost++ 
  - fix fonts not being fully displayed on warcraft3mapmangerStyledWithoutFullscreen and warcraft3mapmanagerUnstyled
